# Install (Hetzner + nixos-anywhere + images)

## Install clawdlets (CLI)

If you’re using clawdlets as intended (CLI-first; no need to clone this repo):

```bash
npm install -g clawdlets
clawdlets --help
```

## Project repo inputs

These paths live in the project repo created by `clawdlets project init`.

- `fleet/clawdlets.json` (canonical config: hosts + fleet/bots + optional clawdbot config passthrough)
- `flake.nix` / `flake.lock` (build graph; imports clawdlets framework; usually no edits)
- `secrets/` (committed; sops-encrypted secrets + sops rules)
- `.clawdlets/` (gitignored runtime: operator keys + nixos-anywhere extra-files + image outputs)
- `fleet/workspaces/` (AGENTS/SOUL/TOOLS/IDENTITY/USER/HEARTBEAT seeded into workspaces)
- `.clawdlets/infra/opentofu/<host>/terraform.tfstate` (gitignored; keep single-operator policy)

## Hetzner Cloud specifics (non-negotiable)

- Firmware: legacy BIOS (SeaBIOS) → GRUB (i386-pc) + GPT `EF02` BIOS boot partition (no EFI/systemd-boot).
- Networking: DHCP via `systemd-networkd` (Hetzner hands out `/32` + gateway `172.31.1.1`).
- Initrd: must include virtio modules or the VM won’t boot (`virtio_*` in `boot.initrd.availableKernelModules`).

## Deterministic dev env (recommended)

If you use `devenv` (devenv.sh), the project repo includes `devenv.nix` to provide a consistent toolchain
(`pnpm`, `sops`, `age`, `jq`, `gh`, etc).

From the project repo root:

```bash
devenv shell
```

## Tooling bundle (optional)

Default install uses `clawdbot-gateway` only (small, reliable bootstrap).

If you want the additional tools in PATH (e.g. `summarize`, `oracle`, etc), enable:

```nix
services.clawdbotFleet.tools.enable = true;
```

## Image upload helper (optional)

If you plan to import raw images, install `hcloud-upload-image` (Go CLI):

```bash
go install github.com/apricote/hcloud-upload-image@latest
```

## 0) Prefill checklist

- `fleet/clawdlets.json`
  - `fleet.botOrder`
  - `fleet.bots.<bot>.profile` (skills, github, discordTokenSecret, modelSecrets, ...)
  - `fleet.bots.<bot>.clawdbot` (raw clawdbot config; routing/channels live here)
  - optional: `fleet/workspaces/bots/<bot>/` (workspace docs + custom skills)
  - `hosts.<host>.sshAuthorizedKeys`
  - `hosts.<host>.diskDevice`
  - `hosts.<host>.tailnet`
  - `hosts.<host>.hetzner.image` (only for image-based bootstrap)
  - `hosts.<host>.enable = true` (disabled by default in the public template)
- `secrets/.sops.yaml`
  - creation rules + recipients for `secrets/hosts/clawdbot-fleet-host/*.yaml` (generated by `clawdlets secrets init`)
- `secrets/hosts/clawdbot-fleet-host/`
  - `tailscale_auth_key.yaml` (required when `hosts.<host>.tailnet.mode = "tailscale"`)
  - `admin_password_hash.yaml` (required; for `sudo` on admin user)
  - per-bot channel tokens referenced via `fleet.bots.<bot>.profile.discordTokenSecret` (template uses `discord_token_<bot>`)
  - optional: skill secrets / hook tokens / GitHub App key / restic secrets
  - optional: `root_password_hash` (console-only; keep root SSH disabled; requires `enableRootPassword = true`)
- `.clawdlets/extra-files/clawdbot-fleet-host/var/lib/sops-nix/key.txt`
  - host age key installed to `/var/lib/sops-nix/key.txt` during nixos-anywhere

## Disk device (required)

Disk device is read from `hosts.<host>.diskDevice` in `fleet/clawdlets.json` (or via `clawdlets host set --disk-device ...`).

Example:

```json
{
  "hosts": {
    "clawdbot-fleet-host": {
      "diskDevice": "/dev/sda"
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting required values

### Hetzner API token (HCLOUD_TOKEN)

Create a token in the Hetzner Cloud Console:

- https://console.hetzner.cloud/ → Security → API Tokens

### Admin CIDR (ADMIN_CIDR)

Your public IPv4 CIDR allowed to SSH during bootstrap (typically `<your-ip>/32`).

Example helper:

```bash
curl -4 https://ifconfig.me
```

Then append `/32`.

### GitHub token (GITHUB_TOKEN) (only for private flake repos)

Only needed if `base.flake` points to a private GitHub repo (so the server can fetch it).

Create a fine-grained personal access token:

- https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new

Recommended settings:

- Repository access: Only select repositories → select your infra repo
- Repository permissions: Contents → Read-only

## Admin password (required)

Goal: after every reinstall, `admin` can log in on console and can run the allowlisted `sudo` commands needed for ops, while SSH stays key-only.

1) Generate a yescrypt hash locally (no cleartext in git):

```bash
nix shell nixpkgs#mkpasswd -c mkpasswd -m yescrypt
```

2) Store the hash in sops:

```bash
SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=.clawdlets/keys/operators/<you>.agekey EDITOR=vim sops edit secrets/hosts/clawdbot-fleet-host/admin_password_hash.yaml
```

Set:

- `admin_password_hash: '$y$j9T$...'`

Optional:

None. Root password is intentionally disabled (console recovery uses `breakglass`).

Note: the hash contains `$...`; if you ever paste it into a shell, use single quotes (zsh may treat `$y` as a variable).

To rotate later: update the sops value + redeploy (don’t run `passwd` on-host; `users.mutableUsers = false`).

## 1) Provision + install

```bash
clawdlets secrets init
clawdlets doctor --scope bootstrap
clawdlets bootstrap
```

Set required env vars before running live actions:
- `HCLOUD_TOKEN` (required for provisioning)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (optional; only if `baseFlake` points at a private GitHub repo)

Local dev note (working inside this monorepo): install a local wrapper into `~/bin`:

```bash
just clawdlets-dev-install
clawdlets --help
```

Note: provisioning is handled by the CLI; state is stored under `.clawdlets/infra/opentofu/<host>` (gitignored).

Hetzner SSH key: bootstrap ensures the SSH key exists in your Hetzner account and reuses
it across re-provisions (no "SSH key not unique" failures).

Bootstrap installs with `--build-on-remote` and uses your `origin` on GitHub as the
flake source by default (so the remote builds from source and doesn't need unsigned
local store paths). You can override:

```bash
clawdlets bootstrap --flake github:<owner>/<repo>
```

If the flake repo is private, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your environment (fine-grained PAT scoped to
the project repo; Contents: read-only) so the remote can fetch the flake. Public flake repos
need no token.

## 1b) Image-based bootstrap (optional)

Use this when you want image-first provisioning (no nixos-anywhere install step).

1) Build a raw image (Linux or CI):

```bash
clawdlets image build --host <host>
```

2) Upload the image to a public URL (S3/Backblaze/etc), then import with `hcloud-upload-image`:

```bash
clawdlets image upload --host <host> --image-url https://<bucket>/<image>.raw --compression bz2
```

3) Set the image on the host config:

```bash
clawdlets host set --host <host> --hetzner-image <image_id_or_name>
```

4) Bootstrap with the image:

```bash
clawdlets bootstrap --mode image
```

Then deploy as usual (see below).

## 2) Deploy (pinned)

Use a pinned commit for deploys. Short revs are fine; the CLI resolves them to a full SHA.

```bash
clawdlets server manifest --host <host> --out deploy-manifest.<host>.json
clawdlets server deploy --target-host admin@<ipv4> --manifest deploy-manifest.<host>.json
```

More deploy/update options (and tradeoffs): `docs/deploy.md`.

Note: GitHub flake fetches are cached by Nix. Bootstrap forces refresh (`tarball-ttl=0`) so new commits
are picked up immediately during iteration.

Note: Even if the upstream flakes declare garnix cache settings in `nixConfig`, Nix may ignore them unless
`accept-flake-config = true`. Bootstrap passes `accept-flake-config=true` and adds the garnix substituter +
public key explicitly to avoid “build from source” surprises during install.

## Server type (Hetzner)

Default is `cx43` (16GB RAM). Reason: bootstrap builds run on the remote and can OOM on small machines
when Node/pnpm-heavy packages are in the closure.

The project repo installs `x86_64-linux` NixOS. Use Intel/AMD types (`CX*`, `CPX*`, `CCX*`), not ARM (`CAX*`),
unless you also change the flake system to `aarch64-linux`.

## macOS (Determinate Nix): fix “restricted setting / not a trusted user”

If bootstrap fails with warnings like:
- `ignoring the client-specified setting 'require-sigs' ... restricted setting ... not a trusted user`

Then your local `nix-daemon` is refusing restricted settings. Fix once:

1) Edit `nix.custom.conf` (Determinate-managed `nix.conf` is replaced):

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nix/nix.custom.conf
```

Add one:
- `trusted-users = root <your-mac-username>` (tight)
- `trusted-users = root @admin` (all macOS admins)

2) Restart `nix-daemon`:

```bash
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/org.nixos.nix-daemon
```

If that label doesn’t exist (Determinate often uses a different launchd label), find it then kickstart it:

```bash
sudo launchctl print system | rg -i 'nix-daemon|determinate'
```

Fallback (works even if you can’t find the label): kill the daemon PID and let launchd restart it:

```bash
ps -axo pid,command | rg 'nix-daemon'
sudo kill <pid>
```

With `just`: `just nix-daemon-restart`

3) Verify:

```bash
nix config show | rg -n 'trusted-users'
```

## Troubleshooting: OOM during remote build (exit 137)

If bootstrap fails with `exit code 137` / `Killed` while building `*-pnpm-deps.drv`, the remote builder
ran out of RAM (OOM killer).

Fix (pick one):

- Reduce closure size: don’t enable `"coding-agent"` / Codex during bootstrap (it pulls in heavy Node deps).
  Example: `clawdlets config set --path fleet.bots.maren.profile.skills.allowBundled --value-json '["github","brave-search"]'`
- Use a bigger Hetzner server type for bootstrap (`SERVER_TYPE=...` in `.env`).
- Add swap on the target (best long-term anyway). For swap at install time, you need a custom disk layout (advanced; edit `flake.nix`).

If you have `just` installed:

```bash
just install
just doctor
just bootstrap
just tofu-lockdown
```

Add a second host by adding another host entry in `fleet/clawdlets.json`, then run `clawdlets infra apply --host <host>`.

## Troubleshooting: SSH host key changed after reinstall

Symptoms:

- `WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!`
- ssh fails even though port 22 is open

Fix:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R <ipv4>
ssh-keygen -R '[<ipv4>]:22' || true
ssh admin@<ipv4>
```

Note: `clawdlets bootstrap` clears these entries automatically after install.

## 2) Lock down to VPN-only

After tailnet (Tailscale) works:

1) Set SSH exposure to tailnet in canonical config:

```bash
clawdlets host set --ssh-exposure tailnet
```

2) Deploy the updated system (cache-only):

```bash
clawdlets server deploy --manifest deploy-manifest.<host>.json
```

3) Apply (one-shot helper; provisioning only):

```bash
clawdlets lockdown
```

## Optional: Tailscale (recommended)

The project repo enables Tailscale on the host (for reliable admin access even if
WireGuard client setup is inconvenient).

On the server (once):

```bash
sudo tailscale up
```

Then SSH over tailnet:

```bash
ssh admin@<tailscale-ip-of-clawdbot-fleet-host>
```
