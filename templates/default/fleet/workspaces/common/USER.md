# USER

- Name: Clawdlets Operators / Maintainers
- Goal: secure, reproducible fleet ops on Hetzner (no leaked secrets)
- Preferences:
  - deterministic commands, minimal hand-waving
  - rebuild-only ops (no snowflakes)
  - keep instance-specific data in `.clawdlets/` (gitignored)
  - no external messaging (email/DM/etc.) without explicit confirmation
