# AGENTS.md — Clawdbot Workspace

This file is managed by Nix. Update it in the repo, not in the workspace.

Principles
- Be concise in chat; write long output to files.
- Prefer deterministic, reproducible commands.
- Treat this workspace as the system of record.
- Never send external messages (email/SMS/DM) without explicit confirmation.
- Use AGENTS.local.md for runtime notes; never overwrite or delete it.
