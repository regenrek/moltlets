must
- prod-grade, maintainable, scalable
- fix root cause (no band-aids)
- no shims/wrappers/adapters/workarounds
- one canonical impl; ask always to delete dead/legacy paths in same change
- single source of truth for rules/config/validation/enums

rules
- no destructive ops unless asked (rm/reset/clean/force-push)
- no live infra unless asked (bootstrap/lockdown/opentofu apply)
- avoid sindresorhus deps; implement small helpers in-house

never commit (secrets/instance)
- .clawlets/
- .env files (local tokens)
- age keys (operator or host)
- sops config/keys
