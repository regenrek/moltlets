---

Contributions are welcome. Keep changes small, reviewable, and aligned with the
project’s focus on maintainable, production-grade workflows.

## Ground rules

- **No secrets** in git (`.env`, `.clawlets/`, sops keys, tokens).
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`).
- Prefer deterministic, non-interactive commands.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Tests

```bash
pnpm -r test
cd packages/core && pnpm run coverage
```

## Documentation changes

Docs live in `apps/docs/content/docs` and use MDX. Keep pages structured and avoid
introducing new sources of truth outside the canonical config.

Use MDX with frontmatter:

```md

description: Short summary

```

## Releases

Follow the existing release scripts and workflows in the repo. If you add
new commands, update the CLI docs under `/cli/commands`.
