description: How to contribute to Clawlets.
---

Contributions are welcome. Keep changes small, reviewable, and aligned with the
project’s focus on maintainable, production-grade workflows.

## Ground rules

- **No secrets** in git (`.env`, `.clawlets/`, sops keys, tokens).
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`).
- Prefer deterministic, non-interactive commands.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Tests

```bash
pnpm -r test
cd packages/core && pnpm run coverage
```

## Documentation changes

Docs live in `apps/docs/content/docs` and use MDX. Keep pages structured and avoid
introducing new sources of truth outside the canonical config.

Use MDX with frontmatter:

```md

## OpenClaw schema snapshot (when bumping pins)

Clawlets validates the effective OpenClaw config against a **pinned schema snapshot**
committed in the repo. If you change the OpenClaw pin (or anything that affects the
schema), regenerate the snapshot in the same PR.

Checklist:

1) Update flake inputs (and keep `nix-openclaw` + `openclaw-src` aligned).
2) Update the pinned schema snapshot:

```bash
nix run .#update-openclaw-schema
```

3) Commit changes to:

- `packages/core/src/generated/openclaw-config.schema.json`
- `packages/core/src/generated/openclaw-config.types.ts`

4) If CI reports `schema assets out of date`, regenerate the additional OpenClaw assets used by the CLI:

```bash
pnpm clawlets:openclaw-assets -- --src /path/to/openclaw
```

Commit changes to:

- `packages/core/src/assets/clawdbot-config.schema.json`
- `packages/core/src/assets/llm-providers.json`

5) Run `pnpm -C packages/core test` (and `pnpm docs:build` if docs changed).

## Releases

Follow the existing release scripts and workflows in the repo. If you add
new commands, update the CLI docs under `/cli/commands`.
