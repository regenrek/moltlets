description: Background concepts for Clawlets.
---

Clawlets is a small system, but a few core concepts show up throughout the codebase
and the docs. These pages explain how the orchestrator, queue, and runtime layout fit
together.

- [Queue](/concepts/queue): `clf` job queue, leases, retries, and idempotency
- [Orchestrator](/concepts/orchestrator): bot-facing control plane and cattle spawner
- [Runtime layout](/concepts/runtime-layout): per-bot users, directories, and sockets

Optional:
- [Hetzner Cattle (plugin)](/plugins/hetzner-cattle): short-lived instances and TTL-based lifecycle
