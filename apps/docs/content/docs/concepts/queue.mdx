title: Queue
description: clf queue semantics.
---

The queue is the mechanism that lets bots request work (“spawn a cattle VM and run
task X”) without ever holding Hetzner credentials or long-lived provider secrets.
Bots enqueue jobs; the orchestrator claims, runs, and records the result.

## Components

- `packages/clf/queue`: SQLite queue semantics (enqueue/claim/ack/fail/cancel).
- `packages/clf/orchestrator`: daemon + worker loops + handlers (`cattle.spawn`, `cattle.reap`).
- `packages/clf/cli`: `clf` binary used by bots (`clf jobs ...`).

## Storage + semantics

- Store: SQLite WAL (single file).
- Statuses: `queued` → `running` → `done|failed|canceled`.
- Claims: lease-based (`lease_until`); expired leases are reclaimable.
- Retries: exponential backoff until `maxAttempts`, then terminal `failed`.
- Idempotency: uniqueness on `(requester, idempotencyKey)` for “same intent”.

## Security boundary

The orchestrator owns sensitive credentials, not the bots. Bots talk only to a local
Unix socket, and cattle instances fetch secrets at runtime using one-time tokens over
tailnet-only HTTP.

- `clf-orchestrator` owns:
  - `HCLOUD_TOKEN` (Hetzner API) and fleet env secrets (LLM keys, optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- Bots talk only to:
  - Unix socket `/run/clf/orchestrator.sock` (OS perms via group `clf-bots`)
- Cattle VMs fetch secrets at runtime:
  - one-time bootstrap token (stored hashed in SQLite)
  - tailnet-only HTTP endpoint `/v1/cattle/env` on the pet host
