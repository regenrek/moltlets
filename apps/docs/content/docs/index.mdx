Clawlets is a local-first, self-hosted control plane for running OpenClaw fleets on
NixOS. It is built around the operator workflow you repeat every time: set up the
project, bootstrap a host, deploy updates, and keep things stable over time. The
dashboard is the primary interface, with the CLI reserved for automation and edge
cases.

  Make sure Convex is set up, secrets are initialized, and `fleet/clawlets.json` has
  the required host fields. The checklist in Operations helps you verify this.

## Why it exists

Most fleets drift because configuration is scattered across scripts, host edits,
and half-kept docs. Clawlets pulls those decisions into one repo so the desired state
is explicit, reviewable, and repeatable. The NixOS layer renders from that same source
of truth, so you can rebuild or reinstall a host without re-discovering what changed.

Clawlets was built to solve initial deploy and ongoing maintenance for Hetzner-based
fleets. I built it for my own infrastructure and shared it because it may help others
who are comfortable operating infrastructure. If you hit issues, open an issue:

<Callout type="warning" title="Use at your own risk">
  🚨🚨 Use at your own risk! This project is under active development. You
  absolutely need to know what you're doing before deploying this. Misconfiguration
  can expose credentials, open security holes, or cause data loss.
</Callout>

## What it does

Clawlets centers the local dashboard for setup and day-2 operations, then backs that
with a single configuration file and a secrets workflow that stays out of the Nix
store. It renders per-gateway services, workspaces, and gateways via NixOS modules, and
it can also spin up short-lived cattle instances when you need additional workers.

## Lifecycle you will follow

You typically start by creating the project repo and wiring the dashboard, then you
define fleet and host config. Next you bootstrap the first host, verify it is healthy,
and apply updates through signed manifests. After that the work is steady operations:
rotate secrets, inspect logs, audit the host, and ship upgrades.

## How it fits with OpenClaw

Clawlets does not replace OpenClaw; it extends it. You still author raw OpenClaw
config under `hosts.<host>.gateways.<gatewayId>.openclaw`, and Clawlets applies a small set of
invariants around gateways, workspace layout, and gateway environment wiring. The Nix
layer is pinned via `nix-openclaw` so runtime behavior stays predictable across
installs.

## Where things live

The project repo is the canonical source of truth and is intended to be committed:
`fleet/clawlets.json` for config, `fleet/workspaces/**` for gateway docs, `secrets/**`
for sops-encrypted secrets, and `cattle/personas/**` for cattle definitions. The
runtime directory `.clawlets/` is local-only and gitignored; it stores operator
keys, extra-files payloads, provisioning state, and image build artifacts.

## Start here

If you are new, begin with the dashboard and the configuration reference, then read
through security and operations before your first bootstrap. The CLI reference is
useful once you start automating workflows.

- [Dashboard](/dashboard): self-hosted UI (primary workflow)
- [Configuration](/configuration): schema and invariants
- [Security](/security): threat model and hardening
- [Operations](/operations): bootstrap, deploy, and runbook
- [CLI](/cli): automation workflows

### What are Clawlets?

The name is a nod to **Thronglets**, the fictional game from Black Mirror’s Season 7
episode “Plaything.” If you want the reference, start with the episode summary and
