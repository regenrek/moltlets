Clawlets hosts are replaceable. Persistent state must be explicitly configured.

## Durable state for OpenClaw

Use a Hetzner volume for OpenClaw runtime state:

- Set `hosts.<host>.hetzner.volumeSizeGb` (for example `50`)
- Bootstrap the host so `hosts.<host>.hetzner.volumeLinuxDevice` is persisted
- Nix mounts that device at `/srv/openclaw`

This keeps sessions, builtin memory SQLite, and QMD indexes on persistent storage.

## Backup layer

Enable restic for off-host recovery:

- `fleet.backups.restic.enable=true`
- `fleet.backups.restic.repository="<repo>"`

Volume + restic is the recommended combination:

- Volume handles fast local persistence.
- Restic covers host replacement, accidental deletion, and rollback scenarios.

## Managed workspace sync behavior

`sync-managed-docs.sh` only updates the managed docs/skills overlay.

It intentionally does not overwrite runtime memory artifacts such as:

- `workspace/MEMORY.md`
- `workspace/memory/**`
- session logs
- builtin/QMD SQLite data under `/srv/openclaw/<gateway>/...`
