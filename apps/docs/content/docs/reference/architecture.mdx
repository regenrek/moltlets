## Repos + boundaries

Clawlets is split across a few repos and a local runtime directory. Understanding
these boundaries makes it easier to reason about what should be committed and what
must remain local.

- **Clawlets (this repo)**: CLI, core Nix modules, docs.
- **clf-cattle (plugin repo)**: experimental external plugin repo for CLF/cattle workflows.
- **clawlets-template**: project scaffolding used by `clawlets project init`.
- **Project repo**: `flake.nix`, `fleet/`, `secrets/` (public-safe).
- **Runtime (`.clawlets/`)**: gitignored operator state + keys + provisioning artifacts.

Rules:
- `fleet/clawlets.json` is canonical; no secrets.
- Secrets live only in `secrets/` (sops-encrypted) and `.clawlets/` (operator keys/runtime).

## Core components

These components are the core of the system. The CLI and Nix modules define desired
state, and the runtime pieces implement it on the host.

- **CLI (`clawlets`)**: bootstrap, deploy, secrets, server ops.
- **Nix modules**: `clawletsProjectHost`, `openclawFleet`, `clawletsSelfUpdate`.
- **Per-gateway instance**: one OpenClaw gateway per instance (user `gateway-<id>`, state `/srv/openclaw/<id>`).
- **Updater**: pulls signed manifests + optional secrets bundle, applies by store path.

## Data + secret flow

Configuration and secrets follow a predictable flow from repo to host. The Nix layer
renders gateway config into `/run/secrets`, and sops-nix materializes secrets at runtime.

- **Config**: `fleet/clawlets.json` → Nix modules → rendered gateway config in `/run/secrets/rendered/openclaw-<id>.json`.
- **Secrets**: sops-encrypted under `secrets/hosts/<host>/` → installed to `/var/lib/clawlets/secrets/hosts/<host>` → decrypted into `/run/secrets/**`.
- **Gateway auth**: per-gateway token stored in `/srv/openclaw/<id>/credentials/gateway.env`.

## Lifecycle (happy path)

The typical lifecycle flows from project creation to bootstrap, update, and lockdown.
The dashboard mirrors this flow, while the CLI provides automation.

1) `clawlets project init` → new project repo.
2) Edit `fleet/clawlets.json`, add gateways + hosts + secret wiring.
3) `clawlets env init` → set `HCLOUD_TOKEN`.
4) `clawlets secrets init` → generate sops rules + encrypted secrets.
5) `clawlets doctor --scope bootstrap` → preflight.
6) `clawlets bootstrap` → provision + install NixOS.
7) `clawlets server update apply` → apply signed release.
8) `clawlets host set --ssh-exposure tailnet` + `clawlets lockdown` → remove public SSH.

## Experimental plugins

CLF/cattle are external experimental plugins. Core architecture and operations docs
focus on the default supported path. See [Plugins](/plugins) for external references.

## Single source of truth

Clawlets keeps the model simple: config and secrets in the repo, runtime state local.

- Config: `fleet/clawlets.json`
- Secrets: `secrets/` (sops)
- Runtime: `.clawlets/` (local operator state, gitignored)
