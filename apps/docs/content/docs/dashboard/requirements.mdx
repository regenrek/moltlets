description: What you need before running the dashboard.
---

The dashboard is meant to run on your workstation or inside your private network.
Keep it local (LAN or VPN) and avoid public hosting.

<Callout type="warning" title="Keep the dashboard private">
  Run the dashboard on localhost, a LAN, or a VPN. Avoid exposing it publicly.

## Local setup (recommended)

You will need a modern Node runtime and the repo toolchain so the web app and workspace
packages run consistently. The dashboard also uses [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) as its backend, so you will
create or sign in to a Convex account during setup. Git is required for workspace
resolution and project templates.

- **Node 22+** to match the repo toolchain
- **pnpm** as the workspace package manager
- **Convex account** (free tier is enough for local setup)
- **Git** for workspace and template resolution
