After Convex is wired, the first dashboard session establishes your project and
connects it to a local repo.

## 1) Sign in

Open the dashboard (local dev: `http://localhost:3000`) and sign in using the configured
Better Auth provider.

**First user becomes admin.** The first account to sign in is promoted to `admin`.
Subsequent users default to `viewer` unless promoted by an admin.

## 2) Create a project

From the Projects screen, create a new project and point it at your local repo. The
template source defaults to `config/template-source.json`, which the dashboard uses
to discover the starter files and expected layout.

1. Create a new project.
2. Set the repo root and template source (defaults to `config/template-source.json`).
3. Save and continue to Setup.

## 3) Run through Setup

The Setup flow mirrors the canonical config and helps you avoid missing required
values before you bootstrap a host:

- Fleet basics (bot list, ordering)
- Host config (disk device, SSH exposure, tailnet)
- Secrets wiring (env mappings + missing secrets)

Once the checklist is green you are ready to bootstrap and update via the CLI
(`bootstrap`, `server update apply`, `lockdown`). The dashboard keeps the config
consistent while those operations run from your workstation.
