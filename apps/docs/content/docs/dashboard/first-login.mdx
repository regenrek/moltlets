After Convex is wired, the first dashboard session establishes your project and
queues repo creation/import for a runner.

## 1) Sign in

Open the dashboard (local dev: `http://localhost:3000`) and sign in using the configured
Better Auth provider.

**First user becomes admin.** The first account to sign in is promoted to `admin`.
Subsequent users default to `viewer` unless promoted by an admin.

## 2) Create a project

From the Projects screen, create or import a project, set the runner repo path, and
start a runner. Default repo path is `~/.clawlets/projects/<project-slug>`.

1. Create a new project.
2. Configure runner repo path, runner name, and optional template override (`owner/repo`, path, ref).
3. Copy token + runner command and run it on the runner host.
4. Wait for project init/import run to finish.
5. Continue to **Setup** (dashboard redirects automatically on success).

## 3) Run through Setup

Setup is a Vercel-style command center for the first deploy. It is derived from real
state (config, secrets, local deploy creds, and runs), so you can close it and resume
later. After host setup completes, continue with OpenClaw setup for gateway/app wiring.

First step is **Connect Runner**. Setup now creates a runner token inline and gives
you the exact command to run locally. Remaining steps stay locked until runner
connection and repo probe are green. See [Runner Agent](/operations/runner-agent).
