title: SSH keys
description: Manage project-level SSH authorized keys and known_hosts entries.
---

The SSH keys page manages `fleet.sshAuthorizedKeys` and `fleet.sshKnownHosts` for a
project. These values are shared across hosts in the project and are used by Setup and
bootstrap flows.

UI route: `/<projectSlug>/security/ssh-keys`

## Why this page matters

Setup `Server Access` requires:

- `hosts.<host>.provisioning.adminCidr`
- at least one key in `fleet.sshAuthorizedKeys`

Without a project SSH key, setup cannot continue to Provider Tokens, secrets, or deploy.

## Recommended flow

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open <code>/$projectSlug/security/ssh-keys</code>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add one or more SSH public keys (paste text or upload a <code>.pub</code> file).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Optional: add <code>known_hosts</code> entries (paste text or upload file).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click <strong>Add SSH Keys</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Return to host Setup and confirm <code>Server Access</code> can complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify

- Page shows at least one configured authorized key.
- Setup `Server Access` no longer blocks on missing SSH key.
- Config includes `fleet.sshAuthorizedKeys` entries.

## Troubleshooting

### "Server Access" still locked in Setup

- Confirm selected host has `provisioning.adminCidr` set.
- Confirm `fleet.sshAuthorizedKeys` has at least one valid key.
- Refresh Setup after saving SSH keys.

### Upload did nothing

- Re-open `/$projectSlug/security/ssh-keys` and verify keys appear in the list.
- Retry with a plain text public key file (`ssh-ed25519 ...` or `ssh-rsa ...`).

### Added wrong key

- Remove the key from the authorized list on this page.
- Add the correct public key and verify Setup again.
