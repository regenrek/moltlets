title: Local dev
description: Run the dashboard on your workstation.
---

This setup runs the dashboard locally and connects it to your Convex dev deployment.
Keep the service bound to localhost unless you are accessing it over a private network.

## 1) Install dependencies

Run from the repo root so workspace packages resolve correctly:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## 2) Set up Convex

Follow the Convex setup first:

- [Convex setup](/dashboard/convex-setup)

That step creates a dev deployment and sets required auth env vars inside your Convex
project.

## 3) Configure `apps/web/.env.local`

If `apps/web/.env.local` does not exist, start from the example:

```bash
cd apps/web
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Make sure these are set (Convex creates/updates `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and `VITE_CONVEX_URL`
when you run `npx convex dev --once`):

```bash
VITE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<same secret as Convex env>

CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:<deployment>
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://<deployment>.convex.cloud
VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://<deployment>.convex.site
```

If you disabled auth in Convex, mirror that here too:

```bash
VITE_CLAWLETS_AUTH_DISABLED=true
```

## 4) Start the dashboard

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

The dev script runs Convex (`convex dev`) and the TanStack Start dev server together.
Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
