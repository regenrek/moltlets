title: Setup
description: Guided first deploy checklist.
---

Setup is a command center for getting a new project to its first successful deploy.
It is derived from real state (config, secrets, local deploy credentials, and runs),
so you can stop halfway and resume later.
Step saves persist as setup drafts. Runner execution happens once at deploy time via a single
sealed `setup_apply` job.

<Callout type="info" title="Runner setup happens before host setup">
  Project creation and runner setup are completed first. This setup flow starts at host onboarding.
  Keep the runner online for config probes, sealed-save actions, and final apply/deploy jobs.
  See [Runner Agent](/operations/runner-agent).
</Callout>

## Where to start

Open:

- Setup: `http://localhost:3000/<projectSlug>/setup`
- Deploy (global chooser): `http://localhost:3000/<projectSlug>/~/deploy`
- Deploy (host): `http://localhost:3000/<projectSlug>/hosts/<host>/deploy`

## Flow

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Hetzner setup</strong>
    <br />
    Set <code>HCLOUD_TOKEN</code> and confirm Hetzner host defaults:
    <code>serverType</code>, <code>location</code>, optional <code>image</code>, and
    <code>allowTailscaleUdpIngress</code>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Server Access</strong>
    <br />
    Fill <code>provisioning.adminCidr</code> and add at least one SSH key to{" "}
    <code>fleet.sshAuthorizedKeys</code>. You can add keys inline in Setup or from [SSH keys](/dashboard/ssh-keys).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Provider Tokens</strong>
    <br />
    Configure remaining local-only credentials in <code>.clawlets/env</code>.
    Setup requires <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and <code>SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE</code> from{" "}
    [Deploy credentials](/dashboard/deploy-credentials).{" "}
    <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> lets the runner verify/read the base flake repository
    during setup and bootstrap, and is required when that repo is private.
    The base flake repo is:

    - <code>fleet/clawlets.json</code> → <code>baseFlake</code> when set
    - otherwise the project repo <code>origin</code> remote (the repo you cloned/created)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Server Passwords</strong>
    <br />
    Enter bootstrap secrets and save them as write-only sealed draft values.
    Values are not shown again after save; status returns as <code>set</code>/<code>missing</code>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Install Server</strong>
    <br />
    Deploy first runs one sealed <code>setup_apply</code> job (config + deploy creds + bootstrap secrets),
    then runs bootstrap.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Secure and Verify</strong>
    <br />
    Run the post-bootstrap checklist (tailnet switch, SSH lockdown) and confirm the host is stable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What setup stores in Convex

Setup uses Convex as resumable draft state for this host:

Non-secret draft fields:

- `nonSecretDraft.infrastructure.serverType`
- `nonSecretDraft.infrastructure.image`
- `nonSecretDraft.infrastructure.location`
- `nonSecretDraft.infrastructure.allowTailscaleUdpIngress`
- `nonSecretDraft.connection.adminCidr`
- `nonSecretDraft.connection.sshExposureMode`
- `nonSecretDraft.connection.sshKeyCount`
- `nonSecretDraft.connection.sshAuthorizedKeys`

Sealed secret section metadata:

- `alg`, `keyId`, `targetRunnerId`, `aad`, `sealedInputB64`, `updatedAt`, `expiresAt`

Read-side status projection:

- `sealedSecretDrafts.deployCreds.status`
- `sealedSecretDrafts.bootstrapSecrets.status`

Setup readiness checks read these draft status fields (`set`/`missing`).
If no draft secret section exists yet, setup shows missing until you save that section.

Convex does not store plaintext values for deploy credentials or bootstrap secrets.

## Verify

You are “done” when:

- Deploy shows an initial install that completed successfully for the host.
- The post-bootstrap checklist is green (or you have consciously accepted the remaining risk).
- Follow-up Deploy runs apply changes cleanly.

After this, continue with OpenClaw app-layer setup:

- [OpenClaw setup](/dashboard/openclaw-setup)
- [How Clawlets works](/dashboard/how-clawlets-works)

## Troubleshooting

### Setup says “project setup in progress”

The project init run has not finished yet. Open Runs and wait for it to succeed:

- `/<projectSlug>/runs`

### Secrets step won’t complete

Setup requires saving the sealed secret draft for the selected host.
Re-open the Secrets step, replace missing values, and click <strong>Save & Continue</strong>.

### Token already exists locally but setup shows missing

Setup step status is draft-based. If the setup draft for this host does not have the
sealed deploy-credentials section yet, the step shows `HCLOUD_TOKEN` as missing.
Save the token in setup once to mark the draft section as set.

### Deploy says credentials missing

Open the Deploy credentials step and set the required keys in <code>.clawlets/env</code>.
These are local-only and must not be committed.

Recommended path:

- Set `HCLOUD_TOKEN` (Hetzner): [Hetzner token setup](/dashboard/hetzner-token)
- Set `GITHUB_TOKEN`: [GitHub token setup](/dashboard/github-token)
- Set `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE`: [SOPS age key setup](/dashboard/sops-age-key)
- See provider docs: [Hetzner](/providers/hetzner)
