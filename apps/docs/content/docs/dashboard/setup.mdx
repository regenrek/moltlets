title: Setup
description: Guided first deploy checklist.
---

Setup is a command center for getting a new project to its first successful deploy.
It is derived from real state (config, secrets, local deploy credentials, and runs),
so you can stop halfway and resume later.

<Callout type="info" title="Runner setup happens before host setup">
  Project creation and runner setup are completed first. This setup flow starts at host onboarding.
  The runner must remain online so setup can read/write config and credentials.
  See [Runner Agent](/operations/runner-agent).
</Callout>

## Where to start

Open:

- Setup: `http://localhost:3000/<projectSlug>/setup`
- Deploy (global chooser): `http://localhost:3000/<projectSlug>/~/deploy`
- Deploy (host): `http://localhost:3000/<projectSlug>/hosts/<host>/deploy`

## Flow

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Hetzner setup</strong>
    <br />
    Set <code>HCLOUD_TOKEN</code> and confirm Hetzner host defaults:
    <code>serverType</code>, <code>location</code>, optional <code>image</code>, and
    <code>allowTailscaleUdpIngress</code>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Server Access</strong>
    <br />
    Fill <code>provisioning.adminCidr</code> and add at least one SSH key to{" "}
    <code>fleet.sshAuthorizedKeys</code>. You can add keys inline in Setup or from [SSH keys](/dashboard/ssh-keys).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Provider Tokens</strong>
    <br />
    Configure remaining local-only credentials in <code>.clawlets/env</code>.
    Setup requires <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and <code>SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE</code> from{" "}
    [Deploy credentials](/dashboard/deploy-credentials).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Server Passwords</strong>
    <br />
    Initialize and verify bootstrap-scope host secrets. Setup requires a successful{" "}
    <code>secrets_verify_bootstrap</code> run before install.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Install Server</strong>
    <br />
    Use the canonical Deploy surface. It automatically switches between initial install (bootstrap) and apply changes (updates).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Secure and Verify</strong>
    <br />
    Run the post-bootstrap checklist (tailnet switch, SSH lockdown) and confirm the host is stable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify

You are “done” when:

- Deploy shows an initial install that completed successfully for the host.
- The post-bootstrap checklist is green (or you have consciously accepted the remaining risk).
- Follow-up Deploy runs apply changes cleanly.

After this, continue with OpenClaw app-layer setup:

- [OpenClaw setup](/dashboard/openclaw-setup)
- [How Clawlets works](/dashboard/how-clawlets-works)

## Troubleshooting

### Setup says “project setup in progress”

The project init run has not finished yet. Open Runs and wait for it to succeed:

- `/<projectSlug>/runs`

### Secrets step won’t complete

Setup requires a successful Secrets Verify for the selected host. Open the Secrets step,
run Verify, and resolve missing values.

### Deploy says credentials missing

Open the Deploy credentials step and set the required keys in <code>.clawlets/env</code>.
These are local-only and must not be committed.

Recommended path:

- Set `HCLOUD_TOKEN` (Hetzner): [Hetzner token setup](/dashboard/hetzner-token)
- Set `GITHUB_TOKEN`: [GitHub token setup](/dashboard/github-token)
- Set `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE`: [SOPS age key setup](/dashboard/sops-age-key)
- See provider docs: [Hetzner](/providers/hetzner)
