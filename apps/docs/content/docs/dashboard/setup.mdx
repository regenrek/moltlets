title: Setup
description: Guided first deploy checklist.
---

Setup is a command center for getting a new project to its first successful deploy.
It is derived from real state (config, secrets, local deploy credentials, and runs),
so you can stop halfway and resume later.

## Where to start

Open:

- Setup: `http://localhost:3000/<projectSlug>/setup`
- Deploy (global chooser): `http://localhost:3000/<projectSlug>/~/deploy`
- Deploy (host): `http://localhost:3000/<projectSlug>/hosts/<host>/deploy`

## Flow

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Choose host</strong>
    <br />
    Select which host you will deploy first. If the project has no hosts yet, add one inline.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Connection</strong>
    <br />
    Fill <code>provisioning.adminCidr</code> and add at least one SSH key to{" "}
    <code>fleet.sshAuthorizedKeys</code>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Secrets</strong>
    <br />
    Initialize and verify host secrets. Setup relies on <code>secrets verify</code> to confirm required values are present.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Deploy credentials</strong>
    <br />
    Configure local-only credentials in <code>.clawlets/env</code> (for example <code>HCLOUD_TOKEN</code> and <code>SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE</code>).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Deploy</strong>
    <br />
    Use the canonical Deploy surface. It automatically switches between initial install (bootstrap) and apply changes (updates).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Verify + hardening</strong>
    <br />
    Run the post-bootstrap checklist (tailnet switch, SSH lockdown) and confirm the host is stable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify

You are “done” when:

- Deploy shows an initial install that completed successfully for the host.
- The post-bootstrap checklist is green (or you have consciously accepted the remaining risk).
- Follow-up Deploy runs apply changes cleanly.

## Troubleshooting

### Setup says “project setup in progress”

The project init run has not finished yet. Open Runs and wait for it to succeed:

- `/<projectSlug>/runs`

### Secrets step won’t complete

Setup requires a successful Secrets Verify for the selected host. Open the Secrets step,
run Verify, and resolve missing values.

### Deploy says credentials missing

Open the Deploy credentials step and set the required keys in <code>.clawlets/env</code>.
These are local-only and must not be committed.
