description: Common dashboard + Convex issues.
---

These are the most common local setup issues when running the dashboard. Each item
includes the quickest fix so you can get back to a working local environment.

## “missing VITE_CONVEX_URL”

This means the dashboard does not know which Convex deployment to talk to. Make sure
the URLs from `npx convex dev --once` are present in `.env.local` (or runtime env).

- Ensure `VITE_CONVEX_URL` and `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` are set.
- Re-run `npx convex dev --once` to confirm the deployment URLs.

## “missing SITE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, ...”

This usually means your local `apps/web/.env.local` is incomplete.

- Ensure `SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000`
- Ensure `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is set (32+ chars recommended)
- Ensure `VITE_CONVEX_URL` and `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` are set

Restart `pnpm dev` after changes.

## Auth disabled but still seeing sign-in

If you disabled auth, the setting must match in both Convex and the web app:

- Convex env: `npx convex env set CLAWLETS_AUTH_DISABLED true`
- Local env: `VITE_CLAWLETS_AUTH_DISABLED=true`

Then restart dev server + Convex dev.

## “site URL mismatch”

`SITE_URL` in Convex must match the browser origin exactly (scheme + host + port).
For local dev, it should be:

```bash
npx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000
```

## “missing SITE_URL / BETTER_AUTH_SECRET / CONVEX_SITE_URL for Better Auth”

This error comes from the Convex backend. Set the missing env vars in your Convex
project:

```bash
cd apps/web
npx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000
npx convex env set CONVEX_SITE_URL https://<deployment>.convex.site
npx convex env set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET "<same secret as .env.local>"
```

## Convex CLI refuses to run

You may be logged out or missing auth; logging in again usually fixes it:

```bash
npx convex login
```
