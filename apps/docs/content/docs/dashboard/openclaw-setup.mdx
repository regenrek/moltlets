title: OpenClaw setup
description: Guided OpenClaw enablement flow after host bootstrap.
---

Use this flow after the host is installed. Host setup gets infrastructure online.
OpenClaw setup enables gateway services, validates app-level secrets, then applies the
update.

Route: `/<projectSlug>/hosts/<host>/openclaw-setup`

## Prereqs

- Host exists in project config.
- Host bootstrap already succeeded (from [Setup](/dashboard/setup)).
- Runner is online for the project.

## Step 1: Enable OpenClaw

Action:

- Click **Enable OpenClaw**.

What it changes:

- Sets `hosts.<host>.openclaw.enable = true`.

This step is complete when the enable run succeeds.

## Step 2: Configure Gateway

Action:

- Open Gateways from the step.
- Add at least one gateway and basic channel/agent settings.

This step unlocks only after OpenClaw is enabled, and completes when at least one
gateway exists for the host.

## Step 3: App Secrets

Action:

- Use Host Secrets panel (openclaw scope).
- Fill missing secret values and mappings.
- Run verify for OpenClaw scope.

This step completes only after a successful `secrets_verify_openclaw` run.

## Step 4: Deploy Update

Action:

- Run apply from the embedded deploy panel.

This step unlocks after OpenClaw-scope secrets verify succeeds, and completes after a
successful `server_update_apply` run for the host.

## Verify

You are done when:

- All four steps show done.
- OpenClaw setup celebration is shown.
- Host gateways page loads with expected gateways.

## Troubleshooting

### Step is locked

Open the previous step. Locks are strict and driven by state:

- `gateway` locked until OpenClaw is enabled.
- `secrets` locked until at least one gateway exists.
- `deploy` locked until OpenClaw-scope secrets verify succeeds.

### Secrets step never completes

- Open full host secrets page and resolve missing wiring.
- Re-run verify and confirm run kind `secrets_verify_openclaw` succeeds.
- If using remote runner, verify runner is online.

### Deploy step fails

- Open full deploy page for the host.
- Check latest run logs for `server_update_apply`.
- If failure mentions digest/signature, use [Deploy](/operations/deploy) checks.
