The Clawlets dashboard (`apps/web`) is the primary way to set up and operate a fleet.
It is designed to run locally (or behind a VPN) and should not be exposed to the
public internet. The UI is schema-aware, so it guides you through configuration,
secrets wiring, and common operations without needing to memorize CLI flags.

Most operators do the majority of their work here, then fall back to the CLI for
automation, CI integration, or edge cases. If you are just getting started, the
dashboard is the quickest path to a working, maintainable setup.

## What the dashboard handles

You will use the dashboard to define fleet and host settings, wire secrets and tokens,
and edit OpenClaw configuration with validation. It also covers day-2 operations such
as status checks, logs, updates, and basic troubleshooting.

Project security is handled in two tabs:

- API keys: `/$projectSlug/security/api-keys` ([Deploy credentials](/dashboard/deploy-credentials))
- SSH keys: `/$projectSlug/security/ssh-keys` ([SSH keys](/dashboard/ssh-keys))

## What this section covers

- local requirements and Convex setup
- first login and initial project setup
- setup flow for first host bootstrap
- OpenClaw setup flow for app-layer enablement
- project security flows (API keys + SSH keys)
- deploy credentials and local runner submit behavior
- end-to-end “How Clawlets works” operator workflow
- local development workflow
- troubleshooting common issues
