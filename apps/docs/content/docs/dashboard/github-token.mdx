description: Create and validate GITHUB_TOKEN for Clawlets setup.
---

Clawlets uses <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> during setup/deploy to read your base flake repository.
If that repository is private, setup fails without a valid token.

Use this page as the canonical operator flow for creating the token and saving it in the dashboard.

## Prereqs

- GitHub account with read access to your base flake repository.
- Project setup route open in dashboard: <code>/$projectSlug/hosts/$host/setup?step=creds</code>.
- Preferred: a fine-grained personal access token (PAT).

## Create token (recommended: fine-grained PAT)

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open GitHub token settings:
    <br />
    https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Set a clear token name (example: <code>clawlets-setup</code>) and a reasonable expiration.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Under repository access, select only the repository Clawlets needs to read.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Under permissions, grant read access for repository contents and metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Create the token and copy it immediately (GitHub shows it once).
  </Step>
</Steps>

If your organization policy blocks fine-grained PATs, use a classic PAT as fallback and grant only what your repository access requires.

## Save token in Clawlets

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open <code>/$projectSlug/security/api-keys</code>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Set <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and save.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Return to Setup and confirm <code>Provider Tokens</code> is complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify

- Setup no longer blocks on missing deploy credentials.
- Optional CLI check:

```bash
clawlets env show --json
```

## Troubleshooting

### `base flake repo appears private (404). Set GITHUB_TOKEN in your environment and retry.`

- Token is missing, expired, or lacks access to the target repo.
- Reissue token and confirm repository access includes the base flake repo.

### `GITHUB_TOKEN rejected by GitHub (401).`

- Token value is invalid/revoked, or copied with trailing whitespace.
- Regenerate token and paste again.

### Setup still says token missing

- Reopen `/$projectSlug/security/api-keys` and verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` is marked as set.
- Save again, then refresh Setup.
