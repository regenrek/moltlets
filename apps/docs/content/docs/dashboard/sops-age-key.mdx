title: SOPS age key
description: Create and configure SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE for setup.
---

Clawlets uses <code>SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE</code> to encrypt and decrypt operator-managed secrets.
Setup requires this before you can complete the Provider Tokens step.

If this key is missing, secrets workflows cannot safely continue.

## Prereqs

- Project setup route open: <code>/$projectSlug/hosts/$host/setup?step=creds</code>.
- Runner online for the project.

## Generate key (recommended)

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open setup Provider Tokens and locate <strong>SOPS age key file</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click <strong>Find</strong> to detect an existing operator key.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    If none is found, click <strong>Generate</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Save credentials so <code>SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE</code> is stored for this project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual key generation (CLI)

```bash
age-keygen -o ~/.clawlets/keys/operators/<operator>.agekey
```

Then set <code>SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE</code> to that path in dashboard credentials.

## Verify

- Provider Tokens step no longer blocks on <code>SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE</code>.
- Optional runner check:

```bash
clawlets env show --json
```

## Troubleshooting

### “No valid age key found”

- Generate a new key in the dashboard or via `age-keygen`.
- Confirm file path is readable on the runner host.

### Setup still reports missing SOPS key

- Reopen Provider Tokens and verify <code>SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE</code> is set.
- Save again, then refresh setup.
