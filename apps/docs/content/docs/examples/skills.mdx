description: Allowlist and per-skill secrets.
---

Skills are controlled per bot via:

- `fleet.gateways.<gatewayId>.skills.allowBundled`
- `fleet.gateways.<gatewayId>.skills.entries`

Clawlets expects an explicit allowlist on servers. This is both a UX constraint (you
know what is enabled) and a Nix constraint (it can assert that only known bundled
skills are allowed).

## Enable a bundled skill (no secrets)

```json
{
  "fleet": {
    "gateways": {
      "maren": {
        "skills": {
          "allowBundled": ["github"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Enable a bundled skill with an API key (recommended pattern)

Use `apiKeySecret` (sops secret name). Clawlets injects it as an env var for the
skill at deploy time.

```json
{
  "fleet": {
    "gateways": {
      "maren": {
        "skills": {
          "allowBundled": ["brave-search"],
          "entries": {
            "brave-search": {
              "enabled": true,
              "apiKeySecret": "brave_api_key"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Add extra skill directories (advanced)

If you ship additional skills alongside your workspace docs, you can add directories
to the OpenClaw skill loader.

```json
{
  "fleet": {
    "gateways": {
      "maren": {
        "skills": {
          "load": {
            "extraDirs": ["/srv/openclaw/maren/workspace/skills-extra"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- By default, Clawlets already adds `<workspace>/skills` automatically.
- Don’t store secrets in skill folders; they may be copied via Nix workspace seeding.
