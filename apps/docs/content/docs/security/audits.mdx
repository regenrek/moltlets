description: Commands and checks to validate state and surface risky configuration.

Audits are how you keep drift visible. They should be run:

- right after bootstrap,
- after any change to `fleet/clawlets.json` or secrets,
- and periodically as part of maintenance.

## CLI audits

### `clawlets doctor`

Runs repo-level checks (linting, structure, and configuration sanity checks).

### `clawlets server audit`

Audits a host over SSH and reports invariants (for example tailscale state and gateway
service expectations).

### `clawlets openclaw harden`

Applies conservative defaults to `fleet/clawlets.json` (dry-run unless `--write`).

## Updater visibility

Self-update writes state on the host. These are the first places to look when updates
do not behave as expected:

- `clawlets server update status --host <host>`
- `clawlets server update logs --host <host> --since 10m`

## Operator checklist (recommended)

<Steps>
  <Step>
    After bootstrap: confirm public SSH is closed again and SSH access is tailnet-only.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After deploying gateways: confirm orchestrator socket perms and that only intended users/groups can access it.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After secrets changes: confirm the host has the expected secrets digest and services restart cleanly.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After update pipeline changes: confirm updater status is clean and `releaseId` moves forward as expected.
  </Step>
</Steps>
