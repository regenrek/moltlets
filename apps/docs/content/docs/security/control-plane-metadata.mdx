title: Control Plane Metadata
description: Metadata-only boundary, retention, erasure, and Git write policy.
---

This page defines the control-plane boundary for dashboard data.

## Source of truth

- Git repository is canonical for config + encrypted secrets.
- Convex stores operational metadata only.

Never store in Convex:

- Secret values (plain or encrypted)
- Operator keys
- Deploy credentials
- OpenTofu/Terraform state
- Full fleet config blobs

## Run and audit storage

- `runEvents` stores redacted message text (`message`, `level`, `ts`, `redacted`) and bounded `meta`.
- Structured command JSON remains in server-function return values, not persisted as run events.
- `auditLogs` uses strict action-bound payload shapes (`action`, `target`, `data`).

## Project identity and PII minimization

Projects use canonical workspace identity:

```json
{
  "kind": "local | git",
  "id": "string",
  "relPath": "optional string"
}
```

Rules:

- `executionMode=local`: `localPath` required.
- `executionMode=remote_runner`: `localPath` forbidden.

## Retention and erasure

Convex does not provide TTL indexes for tables. Retention is enforced by scheduled batched deletion.

- Hourly retention sweep prunes old `runEvents`, terminal `runs`, and `auditLogs`.
- Default retention: 30 days (per-project policy).
- Project deletion is two-step:
1. Start deletion and receive short-lived confirmation token.
2. Confirm deletion with token + typed confirmation string.

Erasure scope is control-plane only. Git history and external repos are outside Convex deletion scope.

## Git write policy

- Default: PR-first (`pr_only`).
- Direct commits require explicit per-project opt-in (`direct_commit_enabled`).
- Policy changes are audited.
