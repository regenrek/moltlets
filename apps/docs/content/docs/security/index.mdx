Nothing is 100% safe. Clawlets includes controls intended to reduce common fleet risks
(for example: secrets handling, update verification, and minimizing long-lived
credentials on hosts), but your configuration and operational discipline still
determine the outcome.

<Callout type="info" title="Recommended reading order">
If you are setting up a fleet, start with Architecture, then Updates, then Secrets.
After that, use Audits + Ops invariants as a day-2 checklist.
