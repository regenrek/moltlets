Clawlets configuration lives in one place: `fleet/clawlets.json`. The CLI and dashboard
write to this file, and NixOS modules render everything from it. This section explains
the schema, how it extends OpenClaw, and how the Nix layer stays pinned via
`nix-openclaw`.

## Start here

If you are new, begin with the top-level schema and then drill into the sections that
map to OpenClaw and the agent runtime. The compatibility and nix-openclaw pages explain
how Clawlets extends upstream without forking the core model.

- [Config (fleet/clawlets.json)](/configuration/config) — schema and layout
- [Typed config surfaces](/configuration/typed-surfaces) — how config maps into Nix + OpenClaw
- [OpenClaw config](/configuration/openclaw-config) — raw OpenClaw config and invariants
- [Agent config](/configuration/agent-config) — workspaces, skills, per-bot profiles
- [OpenClaw compatibility](/configuration/openclaw-compat) — schema alignment and overrides
- [nix-openclaw](/configuration/nix-openclaw) — how the Nix layer is pinned
