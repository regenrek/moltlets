title: Gateways and personas
description: One gateway process, optional multiple OpenClaw personas.
---

Clawlets has **two** levels of "agents" that are easy to mix up:

1. **Gateway instance** (Clawlets config + CLI term): one OpenClaw gateway process with its own ports, state, Unix user, and workspace.
2. **Persona / agent** (OpenClaw term): an entry in `agents.list[]` inside a single gateway.

In the dashboard UI we call a **gateway instance** a **Bot** (because "gateway" is accurate but not very approachable).

## Two common setups

### Option A: multiple gateways (multiple bots)

Use this when you want isolation (separate state dirs, ports, credentials) or a dedicated rescue bot.

```json
{
  "fleet": {
    "gatewayOrder": ["main", "rescue"],
    "gateways": {
      "main": {},
      "rescue": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Each gateway gets a deterministic port block based on its position in `fleet.gatewayOrder`.

### Option B: one gateway, multiple personas (agents.list[])

Use this when you want multiple personas without running multiple gateway processes.

```json
{
  "fleet": {
    "gatewayOrder": ["main"],
    "gateways": {
      "main": {
        "agents": {
          "list": [
            { "id": "ops", "default": true, "name": "Ops" },
            { "id": "support", "name": "Support" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Clawlets validates:

- persona `id` uniqueness per gateway
- at most one `default: true` per gateway

Advanced per-persona settings are passed through to OpenClaw via the entry object (workspace, model overrides, tools, sandbox, etc.).

## Dashboard preference: gatewayArchitecture

The dashboard may store a UI preference at `fleet.gatewayArchitecture`:

- `multi`: treat new additions as new gateways (bots)
- `single`: prefer adding personas under one gateway via `agents.list[]`

This is **UI metadata** only; it does not change how OpenClaw interprets the config.

## Workspaces (docs + skills)

Workspace docs are layered:

- shared defaults: `fleet/workspaces/common/`
- per-gateway overrides: `fleet/workspaces/gateways/<gatewayId>/`

At runtime, the gateway workspace is seeded from common + the gateway overlay (if present).
