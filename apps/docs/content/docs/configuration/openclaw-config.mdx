title: OpenClaw config
description: Use OpenClaw's schema directly.
---

Clawlets runs **OpenClaw** on servers.

Most configuration should be done via Clawlets' **typed surfaces** (because the
dashboard/CLI can validate and edit them reliably). When you need advanced or less
common OpenClaw keys, use the passthrough object.

## Where to put config

All bot config lives in `fleet/clawlets.json`.

Preferred (typed surfaces):

- `fleet.gateways.<bot>.channels`
- `fleet.gateways.<bot>.agents`
- `fleet.gateways.<bot>.hooks`
- `fleet.gateways.<bot>.skills`
- `fleet.gateways.<bot>.plugins`

Advanced (OpenClaw passthrough):

- `fleet.gateways.<bot>.openclaw` (raw OpenClaw config object)

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid openclaw.* for typed surfaces">
  Do not set <code>openclaw.channels</code>/<code>openclaw.agents</code>/<code>openclaw.hooks</code>/<code>openclaw.skills</code>/<code>openclaw.plugins</code>.
  Use the first-class keys on the bot instead.
</Callout>

## Invariants Clawlets enforces

Clawlets enforces a small set of invariants so deployments stay consistent and
operationally predictable. Those values are derived from the fleet and host config,
and they override any conflicting values:

- `gateway.mode = "local"`
- `gateway.bind` / `gateway.port`
- `gateway.auth` (always enabled)
- `agents.defaults.workspace`
- `agents.defaults.skipBootstrap`

## Security lint + hardening

Clawlets includes OpenClaw security lint and treats open policies as deploy‑critical
findings.

The CLI and UI both surface these checks. You can run them locally with `clawlets doctor`,
validate a live host with `clawlets server audit`, or apply a conservative set of
defaults with `clawlets openclaw harden` (dry‑run unless `--write`). The web editor
also exposes a Harden button and applies hardening defaults when you use a channel
preset.

Hardening defaults (opt‑in):

- `logging.redactSensitive="tools"` (if unset or "off")
- `session.dmScope="per-channel-peer"` (if unset or "main")
- `dmPolicy`/`dm.policy`: "pairing" (if unset or "open")
- `groupPolicy`: "allowlist" (if unset or "open")

Notes:

- Hardening does **not** add allowlists (`allowFrom`, `groupAllowFrom`, `groups`).
- "Open" DM/group policies are treated as critical findings.

## Schema sources (pinned vs live)

Clawlets ships with a pinned schema that the CLI uses for validation and that the UI
uses by default. If you want to validate against a live gateway, the web editor can
fetch the schema from a running bot, which requires `hosts.<host>.targetHost` and an
active gateway. The same fetch is available via the CLI:

- `clawlets openclaw schema fetch --host <host> --bot <bot>`

The UI also shows schema drift between the pinned schema, the project's pinned
`nix-openclaw` rev, and upstream `nix-openclaw` main.

## Web editor validation

The editor uses Monaco with JSON schema diagnostics so unknown keys and type errors
are highlighted inline. Security audit findings are presented alongside the editor,
and save-time validation runs against the pinned or live schema and blocks writes
when issues are present.

## Secrets

Do not commit plaintext tokens into config. Any files under `documentsDir` are copied
into the Nix store during deploy, so treat them as public.

Use env var references in OpenClaw config and wire them to sops secret names in
`fleet/clawlets.json` instead:

- Discord: set `fleet.gateways.<bot>.channels.discord.token="${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}"` and wire `fleet.gateways.<bot>.profile.secretEnv.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = "<secretName>"`
- Model providers: wire `fleet.secretEnv.<ENV_VAR> = "<secretName>"` (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ZAI_API_KEY`)

Notes:

- `${ENV_VAR}` is the only detected form (uppercase + underscores). Escape literal `${ENV_VAR}` as `$${ENV_VAR}`.
- Inline tokens/API keys emit warnings; strict mode fails them.

Example (Discord token):

```json
{
  "fleet": {
    "gateways": {
      "maren": {
        "profile": { "secretEnv": { "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN": "discord_token_maren" } },
        "channels": { "discord": { "enabled": true, "token": "${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}" } },
        "openclaw": { "logging": { "level": "info" } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
