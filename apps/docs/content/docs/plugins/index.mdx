Plugins are optional features that extend Clawlets for specific providers or workflows.
They are not required for the standard “local dashboard + signed updates” path.

<Callout type="info" title="Install plugins explicitly">
Plugins are installed via the CLI. Keep plugin usage explicit in docs and runbooks so
operators know which workflows are optional.
