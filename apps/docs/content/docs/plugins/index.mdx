Plugins are optional and experimental. Core `clawlets` does not ship CLF/cattle runtime
support in the canonical path.

Use the external plugin repo if you intentionally need that stack:

- `clf-cattle`: `https://github.com/regenrek/clf-cattle`

<Callout type="warning" title="Experimental plugin path">
CLF/cattle are external plugins and are not supported by core workflows. Treat the
integration as advanced/opt-in and validate in staging before production.
</Callout>
